description: Create and manage git worktrees for parallel coding sessions with zero dead time. Use when blocked on tests, builds, wanting to work on multiple branches, context switching, or exploring multiple approaches simultaneously.

# Parallel Worktrees

Zero dead time. While one session runs tests, work on something else.

## Trigger

Use when waiting on tests, long builds, exploring approaches, or needing to review and develop simultaneously.

## Quick Start

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude --worktree    # or claude -w (auto-creates isolated worktree)
```

**Cursor / Any editor:**
```bash
git worktree add ../project-feat feature-branch
# Open the new worktree folder in a second editor window
```

Both approaches create an isolated working copy where changes don't interfere with your main session.

## Claude Code Extras

These features are Claude Code-specific (skip if using Cursor):

- `claude -w` auto-creates and cleans up worktrees
- Subagents support `isolation: worktree` in agent frontmatter
- `Ctrl+F` kills all background agents (two-press confirmation)
- `Ctrl+B` sends a task to background

## Workflow

1. Show current worktrees: `git worktree list`
2. Create a worktree for the parallel task.
3. Open a new editor/terminal session in the worktree.
4. When done, clean up the worktree.

## Commands

```bash
git worktree list

git worktree add ../project-feat feature-branch
git worktree add ../project-fix bugfix-branch
git worktree add ../project-exp -b experiment

git worktree remove ../project-feat
git worktree prune
```

## Usage Pattern

```
Terminal 1: ~/project          → Main work
Terminal 2: ~/project-feat     → Feature development
Terminal 3: ~/project-fix      → Bug fixes
```

Each worktree runs its own AI session independently.

## When to Parallelize

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Tests running (2+ min) | Start new feature in worktree |
| Long build | Debug issue in parallel |
| Exploring approaches | Compare 2-3 simultaneously |
| Review + new work | Reviewer in one, dev in other |
| Waiting on CI | Start next task in worktree |

## Guardrails

- Each worktree is a full working copy — changes are isolated.
- Before removing a worktree, verify changes are committed: `git -C ../project-feat status`
- Don't forget to clean up worktrees when done (`git worktree prune`).
- Avoid editing the same files in multiple worktrees simultaneously.

## Output

- Current worktree list
- Created worktree path and branch
- Instructions for opening a new session
